This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation for the paper:**Towards Multi-Treatment Task Learning and Subclass Balancing for Medication Recommendation.**



## Installation

1. Clone this git repository and change directory to this repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/2391134843/DifMTT
   cd DifMTT/
   ```

2. A new [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html) is suggested. 

   ```bash
   conda create --name DifMTT python=3.9
   ```

3. Activate the newly created environment.

   ```bash
   conda activate DifMTT
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```




## Download the data

1. You must have obtained access to [MIMIC-III](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/) and [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/) databases before running the code. 

2. Download the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets, then unzip and put them in the `data/input/` directory. Specifically, you need to download the following files from MIMIC-III: `DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv`, `PRESCRIPTIONS.csv`, and `PROCEDURES_ICD.csv`, and the following files from MIMIC-IV: `DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv`, `PRESCRIPTIONS.csv`, and `PROCEDURES_ICD.csv`.

3. Download the [drugbank_drugs_info.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EzIlVeiIR6LFtrBnhzAth4fJt6H_ljxk/view?usp=sharing) and [drug-DDI.csv]( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mnPc0O0ztz0fkv3HF-dpmBb8PLWsEoDz/view?usp=sharing) files, and put them in the `data/input/` directory.

## Process the data

Run the following command to process the data:

```bash
python process.py
```

If things go well, the processed data will be saved in the `data/output/` directory. You can run the models now!

## Run the models

```bash
cd src
bash run_DifMTT.sh
```

You can modify the hyperparameters in `run_DifMTT.sh` according to your needs.
